# Causal Study of Physical Healthâ€™s Role in Heart Diseases

## Project Overview
This project explores the causal relationship between physical activity and heart disease, focusing on both population-level and individualized treatment effects. By leveraging causal inference methodologies such as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), propensity score matching (PSM), and machine learning frameworks, this study provides robust insights into the impact of physical activity on heart disease prevention.

## Motivation
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, posing significant health and economic challenges. While physical activity is widely recognized as a protective factor, its causal impact remains underexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying key confounders, estimating causal effects, and offering actionable recommendations for public health policies.

## Key Features
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):** Used to identify confounders and establish causal relationships.
- **Average Treatment Effect (ATE):** Measures the overall impact of physical activity on heart disease risk.
- **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE):** Explores individual variations in treatment effects across subgroups.
- **SHAP Analysis:** Provides interpretability for key predictors driving treatment effects.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**
   - Dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease).
   - Steps included handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature encoding.

2. **Causal Inference Approaches**
   - **DAG Construction:** Identified confounders such as BMI, Smoking, and Physical Health.
   - **Back-Door Adjustment:** Controlled for confounders using regression models.
   - **Propensity Score Matching (PSM):** Balanced treated and control groups for unbiased estimates.
   - **Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW):** Created a pseudo-population to control for confounders.
   - **S-Learner Framework:** Integrated with Random Forests for estimating HTE.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Validated using Estimated Root Mean Squared Error (ERMSE).
   - Conducted SHAP analysis for feature interpretability.

## Key Results
- Physical activity reduces the risk of heart disease by approximately **3.5%** (ATE).
- Subgroup analysis highlights significant variations in treatment effects, with factors like Smoking and BMI influencing outcomes.
- SHAP analysis identifies **Physical Health**, **BMI**, and **Smoking** as the most critical predictors.
